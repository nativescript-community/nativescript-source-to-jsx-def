# nativescript-source-to-jsx-def

This library provides functions which allow you to generate JSX definitions for `svelte-native` and `react nativescript`.

It can generate the JSX for the core widgets from a clone of repo.
It can generate the JSX for nativescript plugins from their node_module path.

See index.ts for basic usage as this is intended for integration with build tools or a yet to be developed CLI tool and is probably not the package you are looking for.
